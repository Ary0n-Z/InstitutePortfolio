#Task
It is necessary to implement the Gaussian elimination and
iterative relaxation methods. Methods are tested on system of linear equations 1-5

##Implementation
**Language** : —Å++
**Files description** :
 - 1-5.csv - store systems of linear equations
 - LinearSystemElimination.cpp - implementation of methods
 - MatrixFunctions.cpp - contains some matrix measures
